# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard
This project is an "IBM: Python for Data Science" assignment which was submitted on Coursera. 

My task was to extract financial data like historical share price, and revenue using Python libraries and web-scraping.
The data I worked on were for Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
